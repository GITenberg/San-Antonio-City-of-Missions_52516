<h2 id="c1">San Antonio</h2>
<p>From a village of <i>Tejas</i> Indians has grown the modern city of
San Antonio ... not completely modern, for there still remain many
evidences of the past, even though towering skyscrapers mark the city
as progressive and prosperous. San Antonio is filled with picturesque
charm and interesting contrasts. Off busy downtown streets one will
find in bold relief buildings, as well as customs, that date back to times
when the city was settled by Spanish conquistadors.</p>
<p>The Spanish, fearing encroachment in Texas by the French in
the late seventeenth century, set out to make good their original
claims by establishing forts and missions in East Texas. Captain Don
Domingo Teran de los Rios was named governor of the new Spanish
dominion and, in 1691 during a journey across Texas accompanied by
Father Damian Massanet, missionary and explorer, paused here at an
Indian Village. Mass was said on the site, a great many salutes were
fired, and the place was named &ldquo;San Antonio&rdquo;.</p>
<p>No permanent settlement was established, however, but later
other expeditions passing this way encamped here. The French explorer
and trader, Louis Juchereau de Saint Dennis, claiming his
interest to be the establishment of trade relations between Louisiana
and Mexico, stopped near the headwaters of the San Antonio River
in 1714, admired the charms of the place, and declared the location
to be an ideal spot for founding a permanent community. St. Dennis&rsquo;
activity in the area aroused the Spanish authorities. Rivalry for the
possessions of Texas broke out anew.</p>
<p>In 1718 the Spanish viceroy, desiring a point midway between
the East Texas Missions and the Spanish Presidio of northern Mexico,
established here as a fortress the Royal Presidio of <i>San Antonio de
Bejar</i>, and founded the mission <i>San Antonio de Valero</i> (The Alamo).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>This step marked the real founding of San Antonio. Within the
next thirteen years the building of four more missions got under way.
King Philip of Spain began colonization of the province, when in 1731
sixteen Canary Island families arrived and settled in San Antonio.
This settlement was known as the &ldquo;<i>Villa de San Fernando</i>&rdquo;, and it is on
the site of this original settlement that the Old San Fernando Cathedral
stands today. This little villa in the wilderness formed the
nucleus about which San Antonio gradually developed. Many prominent
citizens today are descendants of these early settlers.</p>
<p>Progress for the community during the next half century was
slow, for San Antonio was on trails seldom traveled and was brought
into little contact with the outside world. The missions established
earlier in the century prospered, expanded and then declined. In
1793-94 they were secularized and ceased to function as church settlements.
Then followed a period of waning Spanish religious and
political influence. In 1811 Mexico revolted against Spain and San
Antonio was occupied several times, alternately by Mexican Revolutionists
and Spanish Royalists.</p>
<p>In 1820 Moses Austin, a Connecticut Yankee living in Missouri,
left his home and traveled to San Antonio, seeking permission of the
Spanish authorities, still in power, to establish a colony of Americans
in Texas. After Austin&rsquo;s death from hardships encountered during
his trip, approval was granted his plan and it was carried out by his
son, Stephen F. Austin. The years 1821 to 1836 saw a flood of Anglo-American
immigration pouring in.</p>
<p>Mexico achieved her independence from Spain in 1821 and San
Antonio and Texas came under the domination of the newly formed
Mexican government which put forth inconsistent confused policies.
The earlier liberal grants to the Anglo-Americans were questioned.
Following a series of revolutions begun in 1829, unscrupulous
rulers successfully seized power in Mexico. Their unjust acts and
despotic decrees led to revolution in Texas. The Texans formed an
army, and in November 1835 established a provisional government.</p>
<p>In 1836, at the former mission San Antonio de Valero, the
famous battle of the Alamo was fought. W. B. Travis, James Bonham,
James Bowie, David Crockett and some 180 Texans held off, from
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
February 23 to March 6, the Mexican army of more than 5000 troops
under General Lopez de Santa Anna. The Mexicans finally broke
over the mission walls on the morning of March 6 and bayoneted or
knifed the entire garrison. Santa Anna was decisively beaten by
Texans under General Sam Houston at the battle of San Jacinto
forty-six days later. Following this San Antonio came under the rule
of the newly formed Republic of Texas.</p>
<p>The year 1845 saw the annexation of Texas to the United States.
In 1861, during the war between the States, Texas seceded from the
Union. New times began in 1865 at the close of the Civil War. San
Antonio became the center of a cattle empire. Longhorns were driven
northward up the trails to market; mile-long wagon trains from
Mexico began to come through the city. The Southern Pacific Railroad
was constructed through this section in 1877. In 1898 the
Spanish-American War again stimulated military activity in San
Antonio and Colonel Theodore Roosevelt trained his Rough Riders
at the site now marked by Roosevelt Park.</p>
<p>And so until 1900 San Antonio had a colorful life. Then it
settled down to consistent growth and progress. Oil was discovered
near the city. Hundreds of new families came to make this their home
because of the natural beauty, the mild climate, the healthfulness and
business opportunities. But progress proceeds without dimming the
past and it is the past that draws thousands of visitors to this unique
city of picturesque contrasts.</p>
<p>Today, more than 2,000 acres are included in the city&rsquo;s 60 parks
and plazas. One of the most complete city park systems in the nation,
Brackenridge Park embraces 320 acres. Among its interesting features
is a Zoo which ranks among the nation&rsquo;s largest and best.</p>
<p>The San Antonio River which finds its source in numerous flowing
springs just north of Brackenridge Park and winds its way
through the business section of the city, has been transformed into a
beautiful Venetian canal with walkways below the street level along
banks lined with semi-tropical flowers and shrubs.</p>
<p>An important military center since its beginning, San Antonio
now possesses the largest permanent army post of the nation in Fort
Sam Houston, headquarters for the Eighth Corps Area. An arsenal
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
is located here, Normoyle Quartermaster Depot and Camps Stanley
and Bullis. San Antonio saw the birth of the air corps in 1910 and
today are located here the military flying fields of Randolph, the
&ldquo;West Point of the Air&rdquo;; Kelly, Duncan and Brooks.</p>
<p>Thus the past two hundred years have seen much colorful drama
enacted under the flags of France, Spain, Mexico, the Republic of
Texas, the Confederacy, and the United States. Each flag has left
mirrored a part of its own significance. The curious mixture of old
and new which is San Antonio has been recorded in the pages of
this book.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="caphead">One of the most famed historic shrines in the United States is the
Alamo, the old chapel of <i>Mission San Antonio de Valero</i>, founded in
1718. Here on March 6, 1836, a band of less than 200 Texas patriots
valiantly defending the Alamo against more than 5,000 troops
of Santa Anna, the Mexican general, were massacred. &ldquo;Remember
the Alamo!&rdquo; became the battle-cry of other Texans. Santa Anna
was later defeated by General Sam Houston&rsquo;s forces at the battle
of San Jacinto.</p>
<p class="capbody">Most of the earlier history of the Alamo, is shrouded in obscurity.
It was named in honor of St. Anthony of Padua and the Duke of
Valero, a Spanish viceroy. Although the mission was founded in
1718, the cornerstone of the chapel was not laid until 1744. Founded
for the purpose of Christianizing and educating the Indians, it later
became a fortress and was the scene of many conflicts prior to the
immortal siege of 1836. The ravages of time, of faulty construction,
of war and fire have destroyed all the buildings except the chapel,
and even this has been partially restored. According to some historians,
the name &ldquo;Alamo&rdquo; came from a company of soldiers bearing
the name who were once quartered there, and another claims it
was derived from a grove of cottonwood trees nearby, &ldquo;Alamo&rdquo;
being the Spanish word for cottonwood.</p>

<p class="caphead">Mission Conception, <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Purisima Conception de
Acuna</i>, was established in 1731. It is probably the best preserved of
the Texas missions, despite the fact that when it was secularized in
1794 its lands were distributed among the Indians, settlers and
soldiers and it ceased to function as a church settlement.</p>
<p class="capbody">Conception and the other missions of the San Antonio area are
built of adobe and porous gray rock called tufa. The walls of this
mission are 45 inches thick. The topmost roofs of the twin towers
are pyramidical and of stone, with smaller corner and center cap
stones.</p>

<p class="caphead">Mission San Jose (<i>San Jose y San Miguel de Aguayo</i>), acclaimed
&ldquo;Queen of the Missions&rdquo;, was established in 1720 by Father Margil,
one of the pioneer missionaries of New Spain. The first chapel was
completed in 1731, and the entire mission plan, in all of its glory,
by 1779. Time and neglect had caused many of the original mission
buildings to crumble away.</p>
<p class="capbody">As it stands today, with restoration completed, San Jose presents
an interesting picture of the extensiveness of the original mission
plan. It was the most beautiful, the most prosperous and the best
fortified of the missions in New Spain. The mission building itself
faces west, with a frontage of 62 feet, and including the monastery
wing, is 241 feet long. The front walls are almost 5 feet thick and
the others but slightly less. The Mission is enclosed in a quadrangle
embracing more than six acres, protected by ramparts forming the
outer walls of the Indian quarters which were a part of the establishment.</p>
<p class="capbody">Construction of the chapel took ten years, following a slow and
tedious process. As the main walls were built, earth was constantly
hauled in, the level being raised as the stones were piled higher.
When the roof line was reached, dirt for the dome was piled higher
and moulded so that each stone could be locked in place. With the
roof completed, the dirt was dug out from beneath and the balance
of the building finished. The single tower of San Jose rises to the
height of the average seven and one-half story building, and the
hemispheric dome of the church is almost as high.</p>

<br /><span class="small"><i>City of Missions</i></span></h2>
<p class="center">By
<br />CLAUDE B. ANIOL</p>
<p>Travelers who have visited San Antonio
remember it as a city with a warm and personal
charm. It is one of the rare places which
embody and symbolize all that is America.
Founded by the Spanish in the late seventeenth
century, San Antonio has flown the
flags of France, Spain, Mexico, the Republic
of Texas, the Confederacy, and the United
States.</p>
<p>In the midst of an important city which is
a center of industry and commerce stand the
lovely 200-year-old missions, and the Alamo,
whose defense by Bowie, Crockett and their
fellow heroes gave birth to a great rallying
cry of our nation. Nearby are the aviation
stations of Randolph, Kelly, Brooks and
Duncan Fields, &ldquo;the cradle of America&rsquo;s air
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Claude B. Aniol, one of America&rsquo;s
foremost photographers, is eminently
qualified by his intimate knowledge
of San Antonio, his home, to portray
in superb photographs this dynamic
and busy, yet always picturesque
city.</i></p>
<h2 id="c3"><i>American Guide Series</i></h2>
<p>America is being rediscovered today. In every state of the
Union, in large cities, tiny villages, on the open highway, members
of Federal Writers&rsquo; Projects are revealing the riches of the
land. The American Guide Series is a heartlifting experiment in
co-operative literature. Field investigators, cartographers, writers,
editors, photographers, business supervisors have contributed
to the task of producing guide books which shall be accurate,
timely, convenient, and entertaining.</p>
<p>The primary emphasis in the books is upon the tours. Travelers
in cars, on trains, in busses&mdash;campers, hikers, fishermen,
hunters&mdash;will find here the information they need. How far to
the next town; what kind of road; are there hotels, campsites;
what should we see; are there side trips; what are the traffic and
game laws? These are the first considerations of travel.</p>
<p>But the book contains more than that. The authors are not
Baedekers descending for a moment on some foreign spot. They
are writing also for the historian today and tomorrow who
would know how the states appear to the people who inhabit
them. Sections devoted to the history of the particular state, the
temper of its people, the nature of its resources and industries,
the problems it faces and the way it meets them, endow the
reader&mdash;be he tourist, student, or armchair traveler&mdash;with an
intimate knowledge of the region. These volumes are an invitation
to visit America.</p>
<p>The volumes in the American Guide Series
contain a wealth of information on the region
they cover. Each gives an account of the
history and folklore of the city or state, information
concerning the recreational facilities
available, and many tours. Maps and many
beautiful illustrations supplement the text.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
